# Smart-money-guide
# Python Capstone Project Idea Proposal

## Project Title  
_The smart money guide_

---

## Project Description  
_It is a tool where a user is prompted  to input their monthly salary and expenses._
It will:
   - calculate your taxes,
   - deduct fixed monthly expenses,
   - show how much money is remaining for savings and investment
   - Recommend real time investment options based on remaining funds, savings goals and risk tolerance.

## Purpose / Problem Solved  
I'm building this tool to help people with basic personal budgeting while also helping them be financialy literate.
_Showing indivuals how much tax they pay, where the money goes and how to invest the surplus income will give them more information on managing and investing surplus income and it will also alert people on their spending habits._

## Technologies / Concepts I Plan to Use  
_Python concepts, libraries, or tools to be used._
 
> - Python core (functions, loops, dictionaries)  
> - requests (for API calls)  
> - json module (to parse data)  
> - Tkinter (for GUI)
> - BeautifulSoup(web scraping)

---

## Data Source (if any)  

- [✓] API (KRA)

## Success Criteria  

_The app will calculate net salary, accept monthly expense breakdown and suggest investment options. I’ll consider it complete when it handles errors and does the breakdown completely._
